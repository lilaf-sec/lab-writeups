# SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol

---

## 📌 Définition
> **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices such as servers, routers, printers, and network appliances. Misconfigured SNMP services — especially with default community strings like `public` — can expose sensitive system information, credentials, and internal configuration data.
