# SUID - Set User ID

---

## 📌 Définition
> **SUID (Set User ID)** is a special permission on Linux binaries that allows a program to run with the privileges of its owner (often root), even when executed by a normal user. Misconfigured SUID binaries can be abused to escalate privileges.

---

## 🛠️ Impact
- Privilege escalation to root by abusing vulnerable or misconfigured SUID binaries
- Bypassing restricted permissions to access sensitive files
- Executing commands as another user through insecure SUID programs
